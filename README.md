# rconpy

## Description

A python implentation of the [source rcon](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol) protocol.

**At the moment, rconpy lacks a lot of important features and is therefore a very early work in progress.**

Missing features include:
* multi-packet response
* logging
* exceptions

## Dependencies

* python3 (developed against 3.7.3)
